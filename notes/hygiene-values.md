# Hygiene findings: values and their owners

This file collects the findings from the nine-scope hygiene hunt that answer the
hunt's first two questions: (1) values spelled at more than one site instead of
being defined once and read - environment variables and their resolution rules,
tunable constants and thresholds, ports, endpoints and addresses, filesystem
paths and roots, timeouts and limits, exit codes and status strings; and (2)
values nobody can find, change or trust - a knob defined once but where nobody
tuning the system would look, a value with no injection point, configuration read
at the moment of use rather than validated once at startup. Entries gather every
site and every hunter that reported the same value. It is a working document
assembled from nine independent readings, none of them verified by running the
build, so individual entries may be wrong; a later fix pass is expected to find
phantoms here.

1. An entry is removed entirely when completely resolved. No historical record
   stays here.
2. Stable IDs never change and are never reused; removal leaves a gap.
3. An entry adjudicated against, verified incorrect, or whose outcome is that no
   action is taken owes comments at the code sites it names - and, where the
   claim touches a documented contract, the relevant `reference/` or `docs/`
   page - before the entry is removed, so the finding is not hunted again.
4. Once all findings are resolved, the file gets deleted.

## HYGV-153 - Leftovers sized or kept for removed agent-driving features

- `shepr-api` `WAIT_RESPONSE_GRACE` was sized for the removed chained
  `agent.prompt --wait` path; only one app-probe overrun needs covering now, so
  its value looks oversized. Resize it against `APP_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT`.
- `RestoreFailure`'s `path` fields in `shepr-mux/src/terminal/state/mod.rs`
  are never read except by `Debug`; drop them or show them.

## HYGV-087 - Identifier allocation reaches process-global counters and clocks directly, with no injection point and no owner of the format

Reported by the core/platform, protocol/config, remote and server hunters.

- `crates/shepr-core/src/layout.rs`: `static NEXT_PANE_ID`. `PaneId::alloc()`
  reads it, and `alloc_from(&counter)` exists purely so the exhaustion test can
  inject one. Any test wanting deterministic pane ids must use `from_raw`, which
  bypasses validation entirely: it accepts `0`, the documented placeholder, while
  `collect_validated_ids` rejects `0`. Fix: `PaneId::from_raw -> Option<PaneId>`
  is a compiler-enforced signature change; removing the global needs an allocator
  value threaded through `Workspace`, which is the larger and better fix.
- `crates/shepr-protocol/src/ids.rs`'s doc claims `TerminalId` is an "opaque
  identity for a server-owned terminal ... callers must not derive it from a pane
  id or layout position", while `TerminalId` has a public `From<String>` and a
  non-`cfg`-gated `pub fn test_new`, so deriving one from anything is a one-liner.
  Removing `From<String>` and gating `test_new` makes the claim structural.
